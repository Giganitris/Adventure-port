Colossal Cave Adventure ports (to Linux)

I've decided that I need some sort of project to work on to keep me busy. For the longest time, I couldn't come up with any ideas, until I decided to port the classic game Colossal Cave Adventure, to modern computer systems. Currently, I've collected several source versions of the game and a binary. I essentially plan on rewriting the whole game, almost from scratch, but largely based on the original code and binaries. I'd be glad to find as many existing versions of this game as possible, so I can rewrite the many diffrent versions of this game. By the end, I plan on having several modern versions of this game completely functional. Each port of the game should find itself in their own, individual branches, with the master branch containing standardizations between the branches. If you're bored and looking for a project, I don't think I'd mind having contributers. Also, I may end up writing a single, standard version of the game once I'm done rewriting the ports.
